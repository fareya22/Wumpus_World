# Wumpus_World
# Team: AI-dle
This project consists of developing and implementing a computer program that can simulate the
navigation of a logical agent in a given environment. The project will help you understand logical
representation and logical inference.
# Wumpus World Description
The Wumpus world is a cave consisting of rooms connected by passageways. Lurking somewhere in
the cave is the terrible Wumpus, a beast that eats anyone who enters its room. The Wumpus can be
shot by an agent, but the agent has only one arrow. Some rooms contain bottomless pits that will trap
anyone who wanders into these rooms. The only mitigating feature of this bleak environment is the
possibility of finding a heap of gold. We use a larger 10 X 10 grid.
